# Taskly V2 Prototype

Taskly is a lightweight project and task management tool designed for teams and individuals to manage sprints, backlog tasks, and track progress using a Kanban board. It allows users to create, edit, delete, and organize tasks visually across customizable columns.

[Live Demo](https://senslay.github.io/taskly-v2/)

## To do:

- Implement Overview Page
- Improve UI Design- especially the Tasks list in the Board page
- Maybe a Landing page?
- Fake login/signup page?
- Allow users to input a project name?
